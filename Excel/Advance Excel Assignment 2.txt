Advance Excel Assignment 2
 
1. What does the dollar($) sign do
Dollar ($) sign is used to indicate absolute cell reference

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)
By adding a $ sign in front of the column and row number we can turn a Relative reference to Absolute reference.
To create a Mixed Reference one needs to only add the $ sign in front of the column or the row not both.
An easier way to do this is by selecting the cell with the reference and using F4 as a keyboard shortcut to change reference,
Pressing F4 once will change it to absolute reference
Pressing F4 twice will change it to mixed reference where row is locked
Pressing F4 thrice will change it to mixed reference where column is locked
Pressing F4 four times will make the cell relative again
